## Installing and Using API

After cloning the repo, run this git code to pull the submodules files.

If you're running for the first time, the --init flag is needed.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

for updates, this should work.

```
git submodule update --recursive
```

With that out of the way go on each folder, frontend and backend and install the npm packages and run a npm run dev.

On both frontend and backend run.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
